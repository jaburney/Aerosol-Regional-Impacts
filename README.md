### Repository Contents
Coming soon.

### Data Requirements
+ Initial aerosol emissions data (CAM/CESM Earth System Model input) are available at https://doi.org/10.18738/T8/Z87COZ but are not used here.
+ Aerosol perturbation simulation output (Earth System Model output) and other input data (popultion distributions, macroeconomic data, crop maps) used in these analyses are available at https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/PLEYEF. For full replication starting from Earth System Model output, please download these data and follow instructions (A) below. For replication using pre-processed earth system model output data, no additional downloads are required; please follow instructions (B) below.
